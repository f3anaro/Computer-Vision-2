# Computer Vision 2

Source code for the exercises related to my Computer Vision 2 course, taken at
the TU Dresden in summer semester 2015.

The programs and scripts are written in Python using the OpenCV library. All
tests are run on an Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.


## Requirements

```bash
# install OpenCV as python package together with python-numpy
sudo apt-get install python-opencv
```
